A (very) simple program that hopefully will keep track of the CD's the user listens.

#I am currently doing the "Learn Ruby" program in Codeacademy.org and, as I am doing the "A Night at the Movies" exercise, which consists in creating a program that keeps track of the movie ratings, I thought it would be a good a idea to try to improve the code that is being created and apply it to cd's.

This is really just for practise / fun! =) 
Ah, and try to learn how to work with GitHub along the process!
